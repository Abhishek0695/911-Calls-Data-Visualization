In this project, I have analyzed 911 calls data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert), created visualizations and derived some insights related to the calls.
The analysis is done in Jupyter Notebook using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn. Please have a look at Jupyter Notebook(911 calls analysis) to have
a closer look at the analysis.
